This is a collection of games played by "Master" and "Magist", a new version of
DeepMind's AlphaGo, in the last days of 2016 and the first days of 2017.

I have collected the games from various sources and tried to clean up the SGF
markup. Timestamps are from the server or best guesses, so because of time
zones they may be different than what was reported on forums and on social
media.

It is quite likely that there are mistakes, especially in the result markup
(RE[]) and the player rankings (WR[] and BR[]). Please let me know about these
mistakes at marcel@cpan.org or tell me on Twitter (@hanekomu). I will update
this zip file with a new version so the link to the zip file will stay the
same.
