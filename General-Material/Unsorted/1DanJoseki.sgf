(;B[qc]
;W[qi]LB[ph:A][pi:B][pj:C]TR[qc][rd]C[// A is rare but is sometimes correct for efficiency and potential maximization when white has a certain kind of position facing here from the lwoer right. Generally, the two-space low extension seen here is nearly always the move to play. White cannot omit this move.

B or C instead are mistakes in this shape that people commonly make instead of playing R11, especially B. The basic idea comes down to the fact that the marked exchange allows black some corner territory in exchange for ones own territorial expansion, and therefore, white must ensure that the position he forms is actually territory that cannot be invaded.]
;B[qg]LB[pg:A][rg:B][qh:C]C[// Late in the middlegame the opponent may try this. This move can be correct for black in some situations, but not as an attempt to separate white. Instead, it's an advanced technique (albeit rarely used) for gaining outside stones in sente, and should assume that black plays correctly at C.

Although you must base your choices on the whoel board and the goals in a given glocal or local situation, A and B are generally inferior to the vastly unknown reply at C, which completely connects white (feel free to explore variations).

Thus, C is generally correct and A/B are generally incorrect (see variations for why.]

;W[rf]LB[og:A][pg:B]C[// This is an uncommon and territory-insensitive way of getting forcing moves against white in sente. It must be played assuming white might allow black to crosscut as in the other variations.

It has negative consequences for black's corner, but it can be really useful in certain situations. Black usually plays elsewhere now (presumably a move in a nearby fight), as things like A or B will be sente at any time and there's no reason to choose which one right away. Unless it's endgame, B would be a bad move by white. Black need not continue here unless he needs a stone specifically at A or B.]))
(;B[dp]
;W[qc]LB[kc:A][lc:B]C[// White doesn't need to rush into this move. It's good for territory, but black's response at A has some influence on the board compared to R17.

One option for white, strongly dependant on the board situation, is to instead squeeze black with a move at B, forcing black R17 or some other defense and looking to keep forcing at black with certain follow-up moves.]
;B[kc])
(;B[qh]LB[fc:A]C[// It's advisable for black to have some kind of position or at least an approach move over around A or thereabouts, because this joseki will build a wall that faces there.]
(;W[qc]LB[qe:A][pf:B]C[// It's natural to come into the corner since black has deprived white of points on the right side with his pincer.

Next, it's natural for black to try to connect up, since he should want to turn Q16 and R12 into useful, well-placed stones. If left alone, Q16 won't be doing much, and R12 would look like a pincer played against a healthy group, which essentially just becomes a poorly placed early game move. This would become the case if white jumps out now (on the other hand, if white jumps out instead of R17, we just take R17 and get territory on both sides while white tries to settle in the center.

See variations!

Black A next continues with the basic joseki I want to show you. B is possible too,I've seen it played by Rui Naiwei 9P. For the foreseeable future, stick with A.]

(;B[qe]
;W[re]
;B[pf]
;W[pg]C[// Even if this stone gets captured, it becomes bothersome enough to black that he will have to spend two moves to capture one stone. White ends up a little faster on the board as a result (though black becomes thick; it's balanced).]
;B[qg]
;W[rf]
;B[og]LB[of:A][qh:B]C[// If black has the ladder, he plays this atari. It's not an absolute requirement to capture this stone (black could choose A), but locally it would be a little favourable for white. Generally, black should check this ladder before the original pincer at B.]
;W[jp]LB[pj:A]C[// White can play some kind of ladder-breaker, or just play normally. In either case, black should capture the one stone as soon as possible, often even immediately. It doesn't matter if the ladder currently works for black, the point is to set up a strong foundation for the rest of the game. Otherwise, white could white for an opportune moment to break the ladder later on (simultaneously threatening something else), or the ladder situation over here could limit black's options and comfort in choosing moves and sequences elsewhere on the board, which can add up to a lot of loss.

Capturing soon is the pro thing to do. A is a common choice for this end.]

(;W[of]
;B[qc]C[// White is worse off.]
;W[pi]LB[qc:B][rd:A]C[// White could settle easily with this, but given that the right side will not be white's territory, the exchange of A for B is very bad for white. White would rather save a full-on corner invasion at B for himself.])))
(;B[nd]LB[jc:C][lc:B][nc:A]C[// This is similar to A, but stresses influence and potential. Because of it's high position, it's vulnerable from underneath (around B, for example), so this move is most often chosen when black is willing to lose sente by spending it on an additional move after that claims territory on the top (C...). A is common as an alternative because it usually gains sente.]

B is the most invulnerable shape, and is usually used in order to improve efficiency with a position in the south (make a larger area of distance and thus greater efficiency). B is advanced and easy to misuse. A is very common but it's easy to fall victim to exploitations. R11 is less common but is played by many strong players.]
