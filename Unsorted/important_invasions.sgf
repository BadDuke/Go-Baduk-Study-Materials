(;B[mc]LB[qc:A][qd:D][rd:B][qi:C]C[In this case since black is plying a slightly greedy move in terms of the local position (the knight's move is a bit far, it's a large knight's move), entering at A is a good mvoe for white even in the early game, where usually it's too early. The black stone's distance makes a big difference in the final result, so black's thickness (wall) etc. does not end up too superior to white's territory.

Important notes:

- If White chooses the joseki of white B, black A, white C, it will be better for black because normally black's large knight's move on the top is a knight's move, which means black would get more territory this time with no consequence.

- If white leaves the position alone, black can block at D later and the corner will be a bit larger than normal.

This is black's plan, so white should go into A immediately (locally speaking, anyway). If a strong player chooses black's N17 move, there's probably a special whole-board reason.]
